            <summary>
            Represents an integration command that can be sent through a messaging system.
            Commands express intent and are typically processed by a single recipient.
            <para>
            ⚠️ Warning: A bounded context should not send commands to another bounded context
            to enforce state changes. Doing so introduces strong coupling and violates the principle
            of autonomy in distributed architectures. Instead, consider using integration events
            to notify other contexts about relevant changes without enforcing direct modifications.

            <summary>
            Provides a mechanism for sending integration commands through a messaging bus.
            <para>
            ⚠️ Warning: Using this interface may introduce strong coupling between different bounded contexts,
            which can be considered an anti-pattern in distributed architectures based on DDD.
            It is recommended to evaluate alternatives such as integration events to reduce coupling.

            <summary>
            Integration Message is an event that is used to communicate with other systems outside the problem domain.
            The IntegrationMessage is a public event, part of the Published Language.
